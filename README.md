## Features

* A user can retrieve lists of resources in the database via a collection of endpoints associated with those particular resources.
* It is possible to view all records associated with a particular resource by using one of the "relationship endpoints"
e.g. `GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/items`, or `GET /api/v1/items/:id/merchant`
